         <p class="answer">Listens to many types of music but usually listens to mostly instrumental music. Lots of film soundtracks, recently enjoying the soundtrack from the movie "Birth" starring Nicole Kidman</p></div>
            
        <div class="q_and_a">
            <p class="question">Name three designers whose work you find inspiring.</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li class="answer">John Morgan - book designer who passed away this year</li> 
                <li class="answer">Andy Pressman - really like his design work</li>
                <Li class="answer">Emi Takahashi - Fromer OCAD Student</Li>
            </ul>
        </p> </div>

        <div class="q_and_a">
            <p class="question"> Name something (a format, an item) you want to learn how to design but haven't had the chance to try to yet.</p>
       
             <p class="answer">Bicycle - because he used to build bikes as a bike mechanic but never welded the seperate parts together himself.
        </p></div>

        <div class="q_and_a">
            <p class="question">If you were a font, you'd be (you can't say helvetica or comic sans-- both jokes are played). Explain why?</p> 
             <p class="answer">It's a hard to find font called Latineisch. He spent 3 months this year redeisgning this font from scratch and spent a long time inspecting these older fonts and feel like its apart of him. Although he originally wanted to say Arial because it is an imposter (same width as helvetica letters) and he sometimes feels imposter syndrome, helvetcia was expensive and they created arial to be a cheaper alternative when helvetica wasn't avaliable </p></div>

        <div class="q_and_a">
            <p class="question">Name one website that you rely on (try to avoid a platform like google/amazon/pinterest/etc).</p>
            <p class="answer"><a href="https://www.marxists.org/" target = "_blank">Marxist Internet archive</a> it is a good place to look for filler text.</p></div>

         <div class="q_and_a">
            <p class="question">What is your least favourite design trend?</p>
            <p class="answer">Really really glossy 3d rendering of objects - like apple photoshoots that are very polished,designs featuring photography where you cant tell if its a photo or a 3d rendering </p></div>
